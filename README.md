  ## Description
  Developed a straightforward text editor tool that works both online and offline. To guarantee that data is not lost in any situation, a range of data persistence alternatives were required. If the indexedDB cannot be accessed, the application will first try to use local storage to fill the editor with data. This program can be downloaded as an application to your desktop for offline use. Developers can use this application as a notepad for code samples and coding inspiration, which is helpful.

  to install the dependencies for this project, the user simply needs to clone the repository and then run the command "npm install". This will install all necessary dependencies since they are all included in the package.json.
